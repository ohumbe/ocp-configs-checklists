# Setting up Quay as the default internal registry to OpenShift

## Pre-reqs
- Object storage available for Quay

## Double-check that image registry is 'Removed'
oc get configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io -o yaml | grep managementState

## Deploy Quay as an Operator
- Deploy from OperatorHub on all namespaces for cluster-wide access
- Deploy an instance of Quay 'Create QuayRegistry'
- In the Form, under 'Components', make sure `objectstorage` management is set to false
- Create

## Configure Quay
- Once resources are created, the `configEditorEndpoint` should be in the YAML file at the bottom
- Login using the base64-decoded credentials specified in the `configEditorCredentialsSecret` Secret in the namespace where operator was deployed
- Configuration should be filled out - add the storage configuration, validate, and apply to Operator
- Once configuration is applied, it should start deploying the quay registry
- In a few minutes, the quay registry should become available at the endpoint specified by the route
